# True Legacy Particles
A very faithful recreation of the old particle system for the player vehicle.

This is only a <cg>remake</c>, it doesn't completely revert back to an old version, not to mention that it's optimized to work with the quirks of how particles are handled in 2.2.

## Please Read:
This mod utilizes a .plist file called "dragEffect" in your game's files. If you ever consider on modifying/replacing that file, make sure to <cr>NOT</c> use Texture Loader as this mod currently only reads the <co>Resources</c> folder, not in <co>geode/config/geode.texture-loader</c>
#### Why?
For compatability with <cg>Android.</c>
