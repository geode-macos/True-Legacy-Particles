# True Legacy Particles
A very faithful recreation of the old particle system for the player vehicle.

This is only a <cg>remake</c>, it doesn't completely revert back to an old version, not to mention that it's optimized to work with the quirks of how particles are handled in 2.2.

## Please Read:
This mod utilizes a .plist file called "dragEffect" in your game's files. If you ever consider on modifying/replacing that file (either through <co>Texture Loader</c> or not), make sure to restart your game.
